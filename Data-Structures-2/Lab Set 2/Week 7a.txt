TITLE Integer Summation Program		     (Sum2.asm)

; This program prompts the user for three integers, 
; stores them in an array, calculates the sum of the
; array, and displays the sum.

;When AX equals 5 and is compared to 10, the Carry flag is set because subtracting
;10 from 5 requires a borrow:
mov ax,5
cmp ax,10  ; ZF = 0 and CF = 1, SF = 1
call dumpregs

;Comparing 1000 to 1000 sets the Zero flag because subtracting the source from the destination
;produces zero:
mov ax,1000
mov cx,1000
cmp cx,ax  ; ZF = 1 and CF = 0
call dumpregs

;Comparing 105 to 0 clears both the Zero and Carry flags because subtracting 0 from 105 would
;generate a positive, nonzero value.
mov si,105
cmp si,0  ; ZF = 0 and CF = 0
call dumpregs

;When AX equals -15 and is compared to -10, the Carry flag is set because subtracting
;-15 - -10 = -5
mov eax,-15
cmp eax,-10  ; ZF = 0 and CF = 1, SF = 1
call dumpregs


;When AX equals -15 and is compared to -15, the Carry flag is set because subtracting
;-15 - -15 = -0
